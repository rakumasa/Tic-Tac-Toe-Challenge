# Tic-Tac-Toe-Challenge

- Design a tic-tac-toe board using HTML, CSS, and VueJS web components.

- As a user, I should be able to click an empty space on the board that turns into an 'X'

- After an 'X' is placed, clicking on an empty space should place an 'O' and continue to alternate between 'X' and 'O'.

** Bonus: **

- If 3 X's or O's are in a row vertically or diagonally, a toastr message will pop up letting player 1 (x's) or player 2 (o's) know they won.
